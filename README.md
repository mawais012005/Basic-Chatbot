# Basic-Chatbot
Basic natural language processing with NLTK

Intent recognition system

Text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization)

Pattern matching for responses

Multiple conversation topics

Fallback responses for unknown queries

To Run:

Install requirements: pip install nltk

Run the script

Type your messages and interact with the chatbot

Enhancement Ideas:

Add More Intents: Expand the intents dictionary with more patterns and responses

python
Copy
"joke": {
    "patterns": ["tell joke", "make me laugh", "funny"],
    "responses": ["Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"]
}
Add Context Awareness:

python
Copy
self.context = {}

# In get_response method:
if intent == "weather":
    self.context['last_topic'] = 'weather'
Use Advanced NLP:

python
Copy
from nltk import pos_tag
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

# Add part-of-speech tagging
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
pos_tags = pos_tag(tokens)
Add Personality:

python
Copy
self.personality_traits = {
    "humor_level": 0.5,
    "formality": 0.3
}
Integrate External Data:

python
Copy
import requests

def get_weather(self):
    response = requests.get("https://api.weather.com/...")
    return response.json()['temperature']
Key Components Explained:

Text Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes input text using:

Punctuation removal

Lowercasing

Tokenization

Lemmatization (reducing words to base form)

Intent Matching: Compares processed input against predefined patterns to find the best matching intent

Response Selection: Randomly selects from appropriate responses for matched intents

Conversation Flow: Simple loop that maintains the chat until user exits

This provides a foundation for a rule-based chatbot. For more advanced capabilities, consider:

Using machine learning models (TensorFlow/PyTorch)

Implementing sequence-to-sequence models

Integrating with dialogue management systems (Rasa)

Adding voice capabilities (SpeechRecognition)

Connecting to knowledge bases (Wikipedia API)
